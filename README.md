I used react-create-app to create this project. The only requirement for this is to have npm installed in your system and you are good to go.

Please follow the below step to start this project.

--> In the command line execute the command 
    npm install - It installs all the required modules.(this will take a while)

--> To start the project execute the next command 
    npm start 

There are two files named rules.js and data.js in the main level. Rules and data for the flow-engine are taken from there and feel free to change those files.

In your favorite browser go to link http://localhost:3000/

You can also view the project in your mobile browser if you are connected to the same network as your system. Go to the network link shown in the command prompt.

Rules are color-coded and collapsible.

To create a production-ready build. Execute the following command in the command prompt
    npm run build

To serve the production-ready version on your local machine follow the instructions from the command prompt
